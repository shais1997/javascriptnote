Why we learn javascript 
javascript is a language of browser or webpages
it increase the interactivity of web pages
use for formvalidation 


COMMENTS IN JAVASCRIPT 
comments in javascript have two type first one single line comments 
and seconed is multiline comments


single line comments
//this double slash use for single line comments


multiline comments
/*gtljkadf
adsfadsfadsf
asdfsdf
8*/


importance of comments
it is empower our code 
easy to understand for another developer
it is also ease for us too to remeber when we reedit


semicolon ;
we use semicolon ; in javascript for separation in our code
just like we use . for seperation in english sentences

due to automatic semicolon functionality in browser we are not 
bound to use ; in our code but sometime it is necessary for clarity 
or stylish to our code


diff b/w enter and shift+enter
after the code when we press enter console shows output or run the code
but shift enter not run code it move us in seconed line
